# About this project

This project can let you run go test on only necessary packages (modified packages and packages that depend on them) in a git repository. This could save you a lot of time instead of just running
```bash
go test ./...
```
. The recommended way to use this project is to run the program with githook `pre-push`.

# Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Install


1. Setup an environment variable used by `gfg`, add following line into your shell configuration file like `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`
 
```bash
export BASE_BRANCH_NAME=<to_be_compared_git_branch_name>
```
2. Then

```bash
$ cd <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_ROOT>
$ source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asymptoter/gfg/master/install.sh)
```

3. (Optional, but highly recommended) Add caching file generated by program to `.gitignore`

```bash
$ <DIR_OF_go.mod>/.go_module_dependency_map
```

# Usage

```bash
$ git push
```

3. Ignores packages without `_test.go` files.
4. Beautify and detail the console output.
