# About this project

This project can let you run go test on only modified packages and packages that depend on modified ones in a git repository. This could save you a lot of time instead of just running
```bash
go test ./...
```
. The recommended way to use this project is to run the program with githook `pre-push`.

# Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Install


1. Setup an environment variable used by `gfg`
 
```bash
export BASE_BRANCH_NAME=<git_base_branch_name>
```
 
2. Download the `install.go`

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asymptoter/gfg/master/install.go
```

3. Install 

```bash
$ ./install ${GIT_REPOSITORY_ROOT}
```

3. (Optional, but highly recommended) Add file generated by program to `.gitignore`

```bash
$GO_MOD_PATH/.go_module_dependency_map
```

# Usage

```bash
$ git push
```
