# NOTE
Don't use this project's code, always use `go test ./...` for testing. `go test ./...` can only run necessary tests.

# About this project

~~This project can let you run go test on only necessary packages (modified packages and packages that depend on them) in a git repository. This could save you a lot of time instead of just running
```bash
go test ./...
```
. The recommended way to use this project is to run the program with githook `pre-push` or `pre-commit`.

# Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

1. Download and install
